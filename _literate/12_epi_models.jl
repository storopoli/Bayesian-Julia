# # Bonus: Epidemiological Models using ODE Solvers in Turing

# Ok, now this is something that really makes me very excited with Julia's
# ecosystem. If you want to use an **O**rdinary **D**ifferential **E**quation solver
# in your Turing model, you don't need to code it from scratch. You've just
# **borrow a pre-made one** from [`DifferentialEquations.jl`](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/dev/).
# This is what makes Julia so great. We can use functions and types
# defined in other packages into another package and it will probably work either
# straight out of the bat or without much effort!

# For this tutorial I'll be using Brazil's COVID data from the [Media Consortium](https://brasil.io/covid19/).
# For reproducibility, we'll restrict the data to the year of 2020:

using Downloads, DataFrames, CSV, Chain, Dates

url = "https://data.brasil.io/dataset/covid19/caso_full.csv.gz"
file = Downloads.download(url)
df = CSV.File(file) |> DataFrame
br = @chain df begin
    filter([:date, :city] => (date, city) -> date < Dates.Date("2021-01-01") && date > Dates.Date("2020-04-01") && ismissing(city), _)
    groupby(:date)
    combine(
        [:estimated_population_2019,
         :last_available_confirmed_per_100k_inhabitants,
         :last_available_deaths,
         :new_confirmed,
         :new_deaths] .=> sum .=>
         [:estimated_population_2019,
         :last_available_confirmed_per_100k_inhabitants,
         :last_available_deaths,
         :new_confirmed,
         :new_deaths]
    )
end;

# Let's take a look in the first observations

first(br, 5)

# Also the bottom rows

last(br, 5)

# Here is a plot of the data:

using Plots, StatsPlots, LaTeXStrings
@df br plot(:date,
            :new_confirmed,
            xlab=L"t", ylab="infected daily",
            yformatter=y -> string(round(Int64, y ÷ 1_000)) * "K",

# The Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) (Grinsztajn, Semenova, Margossian & Riou, 2021) model splits
# the population in three time-dependent compartments:
# the susceptible, the infected (and infectious), and the
# recovered (and not infectious) compartments. When a susceptible individual comes into contact with an infectious individual,
# the former can become infected for some time, and then recover and become immune. The dynamics can be summarized in a system ODEs:

# ![SIR Model](/pages/images/SIR.png)
#
# \center{*Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model*} \\

# $$
# \begin{aligned}
# \frac{dS}{dt} &= -\beta  S \frac{I}{N}\\
# \frac{dI}{dt} &= \beta  S  \frac{I}{N} - \gamma  I \\
# \frac{dR}{dt} &= \gamma I
# \end{aligned}
# $$

# where:
# * $S(t)$ -- the number of people susceptible to becoming infected (no immunity)
# * $I(t)$ -- the number of people currently infected (and infectious)
# * $R(t)$ -- the number of recovered people (we assume they remain immune indefinitely)
# * $\beta$ -- the constant rate of infectious contact between people
# * $\gamma$ -- constant recovery rate of infected individuals

# ## How to code an ODE in Julia?

# It's very easy:

# 1. Use [`DifferentialEquations.jl`](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/)
# 2. Create a ODE function
# 3. Choose:
#     * Initial Conditions -- $u_0$
#     * Parameters -- $p$
#     * Time Span -- $t$
#     * *Optional* -- [Solver](https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/solvers/ode_solve/) or leave blank for auto

# PS: If you like SIR models checkout [`epirecipes/sir-julia`](https://github.com/epirecipes/sir-julia)

# The following function provides the derivatives of the model, which it changes in-place.
# State variables and parameters are unpacked from `u` and `p`; this incurs a slight performance hit,
# but makes the equations much easier to read.

using DifferentialEquations

function sir_ode!(du, u, p, t)
    (S, I, R) = u
    (β, γ) = p
    N = S + I + R
    infection = β * I * S / N
    recovery = γ * I
    @inbounds begin
        du[1] = -infection # Susceptible
        du[2] = infection - recovery # Infected
        du[3] = recovery # Recovered
    end
    nothing
end;

# This is what the infection would look with some fixed `β` and `γ`
# in a timespan of 100 days starting from day one with 1,167 infected (Brazil in April 2020):

# ## How to use a ODE solver in a Turing Model

# Please note that we are using the alternative negative binomial parameterization as specified in [8. **Bayesian Regression with Count Data**](/pages/8_count_reg/):

function NegativeBinomial2(μ, ϕ)
    p = 1 / (1 + μ / ϕ)
    r = ϕ

    return NegativeBinomial(r, p)
end

# Now this is the fun part. It's easy: just stick it inside!

# Now run the model and inspect our parameters estimates.
# We will be using the default `NUTS()` sampler with `2_000` samples on only one Markov chain:

infected = br[:, :new_confirmed]
r₀ = first(br[:, :new_deaths])
model_sir = bayes_sir(infected, i₀, r₀, N)
chain_sir = sample(model_sir, NUTS(), 2_000)

# Hope you had learned some new bayesian computational skills and also took notice
# of the amazing potential of Julia's ecosystem of packages.
